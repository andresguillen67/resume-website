            I am Andres Guillen, 
            a Lane Tech High School student. 
            I live in Chicago, Illinois. I 
            have taken a business 
            apprenticeshipp and a 
            computer science apprenticeship
            over the summers of 2019 and 2021. 
            I have participated in 
            extracurricular activities such 
            as Club Excel and Midtown. 
            If you would like more information
            on what these extracurriculars are 
            please go to the contact page. 
            I am a straight A student and

            purpose as it gives an 
            accurate description of myself.
